<img src="/images/robmclarty_headshot.jpg" alt="Rob McLarty headshot" class="cv-headshot" />

Experienced full-stack software engineer with over a decade of success designing
and developing scalable user-centric web applications. Skilled in a wide range
of technologies including React, Node, Rails, and AWS with a strong focus on
modular code, responsive design, and a seamless user experience.

With a background in cognitive science, philosophy, and graphic design, I bring
a unique perspective to problem-solving and product development. My experience
spans startups like Verold and WorkTango, enterprises like Telus and Kellogg’s,
as well as freelance projects for local small businesses and artists. I’m eager
to combine my technical expertise and creativity to drive innovation and
delight users.

At the end of the day, I like making things. I like teaching others how to make
things. And I love it when we can all make things together that are bigger than
ourselves!

Other Interests
---------------

**Mountain Biking**\
*2018-present*\
Love my full-face DH laps (whether jumping gaps or smashing tech), but also enjoy the odd XC adventure into remote parts of the forest.

**Skiing**\
*1995-present*\
Raced, patrolled, instructed, carved, and free-rided, but have still never touched a snowboard.

**Writing**\
*1995-present*\
Collection of ontological investigations, technical manuals, science fiction, project management techniques, code patterns, and bad poetry.

**Road & Gravel Cycling**\
*1994-present*\
Love getting lost in farmlands and covering vast distances with my own body’s power. Climbed the highest mountain in Thailand and can pump out almost 2000W in a sprint.

**Hiking**\
*1982-present*\
Adventuring off-grid with friends, around the neighbourhood with mom, or all the way to the summit of a mountain solo, nothing beats immersion in nature.

**Gaming**\
*1980-present*\
Love Settlers, Chess, and Axis & Allies. Dumped many hours grinding to realm-firsts in WoW and FFXIV. My guilty pleasure is Civ V. I’m Intellivision years old.

**Life Drawing & Painting**\
*1980-present*\
Pressed for time and direct from reality are my favourite ways to capture human beauty. Won my dad’s company art contest when I was 3.

**Swimming**\
*1979-present*\
Have been in a pool since before I could walk. Broke three Canadian age-group records which stood for over twenty years.
