I have built products at startups, consulted at enterprises and SMBs, and run my
own businesses. I have a background in cognitive science, artificial
intelligence, philosophy, computer science, graphic design, illustration,
applied research, and creative technology. I'm best suited to be in a position
where I need to solve unique problems that don't fit neatly into a prescribed
box (I thrive in the unknown; tailoring solutions to custom contexts). My best
skill is connecting disparate ideas and concepts across problem domains that
may be more difficult for specialists to notice.

At the end of the day, I like making things. I like teaching other people how to
make things. And I love it when we can all make things together that are bigger
than ourselves.

Other Interests
---------------

**Mountain Biking**\
*2018-present*\
Love my full-face DH laps (whether jumping gaps or smashing tech), but also enjoy the odd XC adventure into remote parts of the forest.

**Skiing**\
*1995-present*\
Raced, patrolled, instructed, carved, and free-rided, but have still never touched a snowboard.

**Writing**\
*1995-present*\
Collection of ontological investigations, technical manuals, science fiction, project management techniques, code patterns, and bad poetry.

**Road & Gravel Cycling**\
*1994-present*\
Love getting lost in farmlands and covering vast distances with my own body’s power. Climbed the highest mountain in Thailand and can pump out almost 2000W in a sprint.

**Hiking**\
*1982-present*\
Adventuring off-grid with friends, around the neighbourhood with mom, or all the way to the summit of a mountain solo, nothing beats immersion in nature.

**Gaming**\
*1980-present*\
Love Settlers, Chess, and Axis & Allies. Dumped many hours grinding to realm-firsts in WoW and FFXIV. My guilty pleasure is Civ V. I’m Intellivision years old.

**Life Drawing & Painting**\
*1980-present*\
Pressed for time and direct from reality are my favourite ways to capture human beauty. Won my dad’s company art contest when I was 3.

**Swimming**\
*1979-present*\
Have been in a pool since before I could walk. Broke three Canadian age-group records which stood for over twenty years.
