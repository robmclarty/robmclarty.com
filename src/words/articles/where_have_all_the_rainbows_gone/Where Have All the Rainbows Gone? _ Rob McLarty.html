<p>The trouble which faces all artists these days, is that there are 
only a certain number of combinations of things that the human mind can 
find beautiful:  our minds are finite masses.  As a result, the more we 
know, the less total possible beauty exists for us to experience.  As 
such, innocence seems more beautiful to us than experience (for example,
 as a child, when almost all experience is, as yet, unknown, there 
exists a great many beautiful feelings to be had.)  After already having
 them, they are not of the same quality as they once were, and so, the 
older we become, the less interesting the world becomes as well.</p>

<p>More importantly, on the scale of cultural experience, the more 
knowledgeable our society becomes, the less we will be able to discover 
of new beauties over time.  There are only a limited number of methods 
in which paint may be applied onto a two-dimensional surface.  Artists 
today are finding it more and more difficult to create new wonders (for 
they have already been mostly done!)  I am not saying that the solution 
is to return to innocence, but that we must make more strident efforts 
to find the new experiences that may still be uncovered.  Some knowledge
 is even required in order to have certain beautiful experiences (e.g., 
mathematical algorithms or sophisticated literature.)</p>

<p>Therefore the more we know, the more we need great artists to provide
 new experiences, and the more difficult it becomes for these artists to
 achieve this goal.  Where have all the rainbows gone?  They were lost 
in the sea of knowledge as they faded from our imaginations and we began
 understand them.</p>
