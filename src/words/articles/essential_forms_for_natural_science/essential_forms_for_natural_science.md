"Everything depends upon the interconnections that present intelligible unity" (55)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Husserl explains in The Idea of Phenomenology that to know is to perceive the
absolute givenness of a phenomenon; to "see that the object [of knowledge]
constitutes itself in knowing."(xx)  The point of his lecture series is to
propose a method for accessing "pure seeing" as the first, immediate, step in
acquiring knowledge with what he calls the "phenomenological reduction."  He
thinks that if this reduction of the buzzing, werring, confusion of conscious
experience is successful, one can be enabled to understand (that is,
categorize, divide up, tokenize, or "chunk" and relate the categories
interconnectedly to the rest of knowledge (all other categories)) what is
really occurring in the cogitatio.

What Husserl is saying in his book is not any concept in particular like "apple"
or "red" or "chess" is an object of thought.  What he is describing is the
connections between those concepts (it is a method of organizing the concepts
and connecting them together).  The phenomenological reduction what lies
between the words of a sentence (it is the glue of understanding which holds
the concepts in meaningful conscious contemplation).

I think the best way of explaining what Husserl talks about is to analyze some
of the key terms that he uses and to present them in a natural order of
dependence such that the more complex terms are explained by the explanation of
the less complex terms.  I will move from "consciousness" and "phenomenon" to
the explanation of Husserl's sense of "givenness" and his "phenomenological
reduction."  I will show that this is a method for grounding the "natural
attitude" (of which Husserl is interested beyond the scope of his lectures) by
supporting his exercise of bracketing reality (epoche).  The science of
phenomenology isn't necessary or real per se, but it is a useful tool for
understanding one's situadedness.


Consciousness (the perceiver of all things)
-------------

Consciousness is the existential thing that is perceiving (the perceiver).  It
is the thing that is knowing.  It is Descartes' "I."  All things being equal, I
am this thinking thing that is considering my situadedness (that is, my being
in this reality).  Consciousness is that which looks out into reality and has
the experience (whatever that may be).


Phenomenon (thought-object)
----------

A phenomenon is that which is being perceived by consciousness (it is the object
of thought).  Thinking is about something, and that thing is called a
phenomenon.  Consciousness itself is a phenomenon when I parse it as an object
in language.  When I refer to that which is perceiving, I am referring to a
thing.   It just so happens that that thing is such a thing that is able to
perceive other things.

I'm not thinking here that "things" are necessarily "objects" (as objects in
some physical world).  At this point, I mean simply "objects of thought" which
could be physical or not.  What is important is the thing's aboutness.  It is
the conscious intention that about which some thing is what is known(or thought
or considered).  All such about-things are referred to as phenomena.


Cogitatio (phenomenal awareness)
---------

The cogitatio is the "being" of consciousness, or the act of experiencing
phenomena, or the form of knowing which lies between consciousness and its
objects.  That is, where there is consciousness and its intentional object
(some phenomenon) the human link between the two is what Husserl calls the
cogitatio.(xx)


Appearance (ness-ness)
----------

If the cogitatio is the form of knowing between consciousness and phenomena,
then appearance is the quality of that form (the "what it's like" of a
phenomenon).  It is that which shows itself or makes itself immediately
manifest to the consciousness as a phenomenon.

"[Appearances] are not themselves the objects, and do not really contain the
objects, ...[but] in a certain sense create objects for the ego" (52).  So,
it's not that an appearance is the object itself, but it is the phenomenon
that is held in the consciousness.  It is the object-as-in-the-mind. Husserl's
point is that this is all that can be known absolutely (these appearances) for
they are the only things that we are able to be conscious of.


Givenness (immediate perception qua perception)
---------

Givenness is the immanent perception that is given to consciousness.  I don't
have to think about it, it is just there (e.g., the redness of red is simply
there in my mind before any other thought I could have about red can be
formed).  This is a very broad concept, and it encompasses a large gamut of
experience.  For example, givenness is also present in illusion and
hallucination and even in dreams or the imagination.  There is no distinction
here about what is actually real, only between what is actually present, or
immanent, or manifest in consciousness.

Think of a spoon placed in a glass of water, the handle sticking out into the
air and the bottom immersed in liquid.  Because of the refraction of light
through two different mediums (air and water) the spoon appears to be bent at
the surface of the water.  In the natural sense, the spoon is not really bent
(because of light refraction), but in the phenomenological sense (as a purely
given sense of immediate perception of appearances) the spoon is indeed bent.
That's just what is given to our visual seeing of the
spoon-as-immersed-in-a-glass-of-water.  That phenomenon is what is given,
before any of the rest of our analyses and rationalizations about the nature of
material reality come into play to reorganize our pure seeing into "understood
seeing" as a non-bent-spoon-which-appears-bent really still straight, the water
causing an illusion of bentness.

What you see is what you get.  That is given.


Objectivity (given appearance as object)
-----------

The phenomenality of the phenomenon (the division of the all flowing, temporal
somethingness (i.e., given reality) into categories of thought
(i.e., concentrated, artificial (and arbitrary) divisions of the aspects of
somethingness into tokens) which can be contemplated by human consciousness) is
what Husserl refers to as "objectivity."(xx)

The problem which objectivity solves is the inability to describe reality in
human thought as such.  All of reality cannot be held in mind at one time
(i.e., finite beings cannot consider the infinity of universal reality).  It
must thus be chopped up into pieces small enough to hold in thought in order
that those pieces may then be psychologically manipulated or understood.

The idea here, is that Husserl is interested in objects as they are for
consciousness (givenness) instead of objects as they are in the world
(transcendence).  The thought-object (the intentional act of thought, or the
object as thought) is what is absolutely real.  It is what the transcendent
objects mean (i.e., they are phenomena that appear to consciousness as such).
It is this sense of the reality of objects that is objectivity.


Essence (the unfolding of being)
-------

Essence is what is given (e.g., red's redness).  If givenness is the direct
perception of an appearance of objectivity, then essence is that which is
given.

It's all about meaning.  I can hold in my mind the idea of
warm-light-of-a-certain-quality.  But instead of thinking in images of pure
redness and ranges of arbitrarily divided chunks of reality, I call this
idea "red" and can talk about it using this reference with other people.  They
know what I mean by the universal definition of "red" that has been agreed upon
as a convention for referring to a certain warm range of the light-spectrum.
Without it I could not communicate in an efficient manner, always having to
fully define my thoughts in terms of experience (e.g., "what I mean is the
visual phenomenon that is present in fires and fire trucks and blood, etc.").
It is much more efficient to simply say "red" when that is what is meant than
to attempt to relate all of one's personal life experience to that of
another's.  We could spend the rest of existence simply trying to communicate
just what visual phenomenon it is that we mean in the idea of redness we have
in our minds.

What I'm trying to say in a convoluted way is that in the presence of
experience (whole reality given at once), we make distinctions inside that
experience of particular properties and qualities that we can section off from
other properties and qualities to be able to think and speak more concisely.
It's arbitrary what we call "red,"  but the redness (a particularly sectioned
off property and quality of experience) is not.  Experience is essential and
therefore its specific, sectioned-off properties and qualities are essential as
well.  Given some property of experience, dividing it and isolating it for
thought, naming it "red," and considering what makes it red, we can see that it
is the redness of red which is its essential feature.  Essence is what is given
to us in experience.


Evidence (an interconnected belief of the essences of the perception of reality)
--------

Evidence is the validity of an essence verified against all the rest of
consciously experienced essences.  It is the interconnectedness of what is
given between all else that has been given.  It is the relation of what is
immanent to what is cognized (what is knowing to what is known).

Evidence is the placement of the sectioned-off essence into the great puzzle of
experience-as-a-whole.  We can't consider all of experience at once (because we
are finite), but we can consider an essence's neighbouring qualities to see if
they fit together with the quality of essence under consideration.  For
example, my experiencing the appearance of red relates itself to my knowledge
of the light spectrum, that it is a certain domain of the entire range of
possible light, that it is a colour, that it is such a colour that is "warm,"
that it is the colour of valentines and blood, that it is not blue, etc.
Placing red into the section of the light-spectrum which is redness is using
the non-red parts of the light spectrum for evidence.  That red "fits" into
that particular, warm side of the spectrum is evidence that the essence of the
phenomenon of red is real (that is, evidence is the fitting-into of an essence
into the combination of essences which make up the essence of "reality").


Universals (common evidence of the essences of the world)
----------

Universal evidence is the related, common essence between disparate minds.  If
essence is the personal understanding of a definitive aspect of reality and
evidence is its placement amongst the other experienced essences, then
universal evidence is an  expanded, public understanding that can be agreed
upon as such an essence between other consciousnesses.

I don't mean that it is "agreed upon" in the way that two people agree with one
another to play a game of chess, but that they agree that the game they are
playing is such a thing that has certain rules and structures that all people
in general agree is what is called "chess."  That is, in the universal mind,
the life experience of moving sculpted pieces of matter across a checkered
surface following a particular set of rules is unified in a way that it is
called "chess."  Chess is placed amongst the essences of reality and validated
as being so placed in general.

This is problem which language solves, but representing conventional
tokenizations of reality and placing linguistic references upon those tokens
(e.g., redness is called "red," and checkered-sculpture-game is
called "chess").  If we did not perform this act of abstraction
(taking particular, individually tokenized experience and standardizing its
reference to universals) we would each of us be isolated in our own unique life
experiences cut off from shared-evident thought (i.e., life as my life cannot
be described but only in a more general form to some other life).


The Natural Attitude (that the world exists as real)
--------------------

The "natural attitude" is the stance that the world is real (i.e., not a fiction
in the sense of a hallucination or idea).  It is a solid, universal space of
shared perceptions.

It's just one possible sense of human existence for the sake of placement
(otherwise, without any other sort of metaphysical stance, what would human
being be other than a buzzing, werring confusion?)  Other such stances could be
idealism or sollipsism, but it is the "natural attitude" which interests
Husserl because of its usefulness in describing the situation which provides us
with a language for describing phenomena in a fuller, more accurate (in the
sense of more descriptive), practical manner (i.e., it provides us with the
tools needed to have a discourse).


Epoche (make no assumptions)
------

Husserl abstains from the consideration of the existence of reality in order to
understand a more fundamental level of how it is that we can know what we know.
That is, he is concerned about not what we know, but that we know.  In order to
start such an investigation, Husserl believes that we must look to the side of
whatness and consider thatness (a diverting of attention to focus on what is
immanent).

Heis not denying reality's existence, but neither is he affirming it.  He simply
wants to hold the "natural attitude" in abeyance whilst he analyzes its
possibilities and validities (e.g., given appearances of objectivity through
phenomenological reduction).  Reality is what is dubitable and Husserl wants to
hold it to the side and make no use of it in the science of phenomenology.


Phenomenology (the analysis of what is given)
-------------

Husserl names a new science that is separate from the natural sciences in that
it is the analysis of the immanent moment of conscious experience (put a
different way, it is the study of the cogitatio and how it is that which it
is).

Phenomenology is not concerned with what is actually the case beyond
consciousness (transcendental judgments are entirely beside the point,
30). "Nothing is ... assumed concerning the existence or non-existence of
reality" (34).  These sorts of assessments of situatedness are left for other
forms of study like natural science which maintains and elaborates upon
the "natural attitude."  What concerns phenomenology is the form of our
knowing.  In this case, that we perceive appearances as such and that we are
limited to judging reality based upon these sorts of immediate givens.  The
appearances are real and exist to be considered.  Whether or not those
appearances correspond to an outside object of material, or are merely an
idealism of mentation, is a question for different scientific investigations.


Phenomenological Reduction (givenness, not transcendence)
--------------------------

The purpose of Husserl's series of lectures in The Idea of Phenomenology is to
explain the validity of his a method for considering experience which can be
used as a grounding for other sciences and natural beliefs.  He calls this
method the   "phenomenological reduction."

The reduction is that our "natural attitude" of the world (that it exists as
really possible) is put aside, and what we are left with is pure givenness.  We
cannot deny that consciousness exists, that it perceives appearances, that
these appearances (as given) are essential to thought, and that they are
evident in their placement to all other perceivable essences
(i.e., interconnected, intelligible unity).  I can doubt that the apple in
front of me is real (perhaps it is a hallucination).  My natural attitude that
there is an apple in front of me prevents me from being able to consider its
validity.  But when I use the method of phenomenological reduction to
understand the apple as, simply, an  appearance in my consciousness (as real on
a phenomenological level) I can use this givenness to relate an essence of
appleness to others.  I am afforded the language (the tools) needed to
understand its reality.  The point is that the apple cannot simply be assumed,
but built up as existent based on what is indubitable (that is, givenness).

This "building up" is what is made possible by the method of  phenomenological
reduction.  It is Husserl's method which breaks conscious experience out of
solipsism and combines with a sense of transcendence a real, physical world
that can be understood as manifest.  Taken outside the individual, the
interconnections between minds and their shared unity of givenness form the
empirical evidence of natural science.
