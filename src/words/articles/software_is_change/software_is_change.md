Software is, by definition, a rule-system for changing data, that is itself
meant to be changed easily (to change how the data is changed). If you are not
designing your software application with the intention for it to be changed,
altered, and/or adapted, you're doing it wrong.

If we knew exactly what we needed, and knew that that was all we would ever
need, we would build it as hardware. Hardware is insanely faster, more secure,
and less complex (that is, in what's necessary to represent the logic in
physical form) than software processing. But software has the advantage of
easily being changed with a few keystrokes and altering the result of the
system for "free" (in the sense that no new physical tooling, testing, or
construction/fabrication is necessary to make the desired changes). This
should *always* be expected because that's literally what software *is* as a
tool: changeable logic modules.

So, when you're typing in your editor remember that it's not good enough for it
to "just work." You should always build any software with the intention
to "work" (for today's current expectations) whilst also making changes easy
(for tomorrow's expectations... because it *will* be different tomorrow).

We don't know what might change or what might stay the same. All components need
to be thought about in this context. Software that can't be changed(easily) is
just complicated hardware.
