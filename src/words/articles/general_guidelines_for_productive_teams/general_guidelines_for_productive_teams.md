These are some general-purpose guidelines for team interaction that aim to
facilitate maximizing development production, balancing bureaucratic needs, and
minimizing unnecessary interruptions for everyone.

1. **One** team sync meeting per week just before each client meeting in order
to group all regular disruptions into a single block of time

2. Try hard **not** to have meetings. Use async comms and informational tools
such as Slack and Trello over face-to-face discussions. This isn't always
possible, but if it is, this is preferred. If a meeting is not necessary, don't
have one.

3. **Communicate** with team members to solve problems. Often times they can be
solved asynchronously and don't require meeting in real-time. Team members
should discuss the necessity of having a meeting and agree to it together. Just
because something fits in one person's schedule, doesn't mean it fits in
another person's.

4. If someone needs to meet in real-time, **ask** first. Maybe the issue can be
resolved async. But all members of a meeting need to be aware of it, and agree
to it, for it to be successful. Don't just assume the other person is able to
drop what they're doing and re-focus on your challenge.

5. If a meeting needs to be rescheduled, again, **ask** first. Just because
something fits in one person's schedule, doesn't mean it fits in another's.

6. If someone has a problem, challenge, or question, **talk** to other team
members before making decisions which affect the whole team. Often times there
may be alternative solutions which may not be immediately obvious. The more we
can
**share** what we're working on with each other, the better we can each
  understand each others' challenges and help one-another meet them.

7. This is a team: a group of different people working together. No one member
dictates how all the other members work. We work together to find the best way
to accomplish our goals, which will necessarily be different in different
contexts. We should be able to **tolerate** these differences in approach or
understanding or working style or values and align on common goals.
