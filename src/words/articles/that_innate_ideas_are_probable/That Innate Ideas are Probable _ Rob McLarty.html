<p>In Locke's <em>An Essay Concerning Human Understanding</em> 
(270-373), an effort is made to deny the existence of innate   ideas. It
 is said, instead, that all knowledge is acquired through experience.  
In this paper, I will outline some of Locke's arguments concerning 
innate ideas, and then criticize them    by showing where they are 
lacking. It will be shown that innate ideas cannot be rejected    
outright; they are clear possibilities (if not, actualities).</p>

<p>Locke investigates, in his <em>Essay</em>, the origin of human 
knowledge.  He begins, in Book I, by analyzing the possibility that we 
(human beings) may come into the world already endowed with certain  
pieces of knowledge. He argues in this book that no such knowledge 
exists and that all knowledge that <em>does</em> exist is   acquired by means of experience and interaction with the world.</p>

<p>Locke states that "universal consent proves nothing innate" (I, ii, 
4). It is said, by proponents of this   line of reasoning, that certain 
principles are accepted by anyone who comes across them; thus they must 
be naturally imprinted on the mind from birth. Locke does not agree. He 
goes on to point out that children (and idiots) do not apprehend any of 
these so-called 'universally consented' ideas. he concludes from this 
that such ideas are not in existence at birth. "For if they are not 
notions naturally imprinted, how can they be innate? And if they are 
notions imprinted, how can they  be unknown?" (I, ii, 5). So, in 
essence, because children and idiots do not universally understand such 
truths or ideas, then, according to Locke, such ideas cannot be innate 
(i.e., they must be acquired through the course of life). Locke provides
 examples of two universally consented propositions: "Whatever is, is" 
and "It is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be" (I, ii, 
4). He says that    if they are in the understanding by default, then 
children should   not be ignorant of them. Moreover, he asserts, every 
living mind of whatever age (including infants)    must necessarily be 
aware and know the truth of these propositions. Because there are some 
(especially children) who do not understand such propositions, they are 
not in the understanding at birth.</p>

<p>Locke later examines the reply, made by believers of innate, 
universal ideas, that "men know them when they come to the use of 
reason" (I, ii, 6). Locke    does not believe that because reason 
discovered the propositions that they are innate. Reason, says Locke, is
 the deduction of unknown truths from  truths already known and 
understood (I, ii, 9). He maintains that if reason is necessary to 
discover innate truths, then we would find  "all the certain truths that
 reason ever teaches    us to be innate," (I, ii, 8) which, of course, 
is not the case. Locke also attacks the notion of 'implicitly' imprinted
 ideas,  claiming that if this means 'the mind's ability to understand 
them  when encountered' then "all mathematical demonstrations as well as
 first principles must    be received as native impressions on the mind"
 (I, ii, 22). As a result Locke believes there are <em>no</em> innate    ideas.</p>

<p>I am not in full agreement with Locke for the following reasons. 
Firstly, infant's minds may not be aware of    ideas which are dependant
 on <em>language</em>, but this does not entail a lack of knowledge of <em>any</em>  kind. Secondly, there are some <em>abilities</em> at birth; the question is whether    they constitute <em>knowledge</em>. Thirdly, the sorts of things which Locke says that the mind is doing when it is in the process of <em>acquiring</em> non-innate knowledge requires some sort of   know-how to begin with, and <em>ideas</em> may not be innate, but <em>something</em>
 is there to start    the mind off on its empirical journey. Something 
is going on in the mind for which Locke does not account, which    is 
most probably some for of innate process.</p>

<p>I agree in a very limited manner with Locke in that "no proposition 
can be said to be in the mind which it never yet knew, which it was 
never   yet conscious of" (I, ii, 5). Obviously a pre-linguistic mind   
will not be able to understand propositions (i.e., linguistic 
utterances). And  I will also admit that such minds do not comprehend 
ideas, where the term <em>idea</em> represents an object of    language. I do not contest this. But is knowledge merely limited to the linguistic domain? I <em>know</em>
 how to  move my arm about. But all this kind of knowledge is in 
ineffable. Thus,    there does exist a certain kind of knowledge which 
is non-propositional (i.e., not expressible in language). So, when Locke
 says that no proposition can be in the mind before  the mind's 
experience of it, he has not stated that no <em>knowledge</em> can be in the mind before    the mind's experience of it.</p>

<p>Locke argued that because infants are not aware of the universal 
truths that all men seem to agree to, these truths are not innate. True,
   infants may not comprehend these, <em>specific</em> ideas or facts, but this   alone does not mean that they have <em>no</em> knowledge of <em>anything</em>. They may   not be able to speak, and subsequently have no knowledge of the proposition 'whatever is, is', but  they may <em>know</em> when they are in the presence of their mother, and they may <em>know</em>
 that they are hungry (although they do not know the word 'hungry', they
 may feel a grumbling in their stomachs and understand    this sensation
 qua a sensation without need of any external, empirical knowledge 
beforehand).   Certainly, when a baby cries when given to a stranger, 
and then stops when given to its mother  (this even occurring 
immediately after birth), it had not a chance to learn any distinction 
between mother and stranger empirically; it is an ability it <em>does</em>
 seem to have, an ability    that is present at birth. If this ability 
does not constitute being 'knowledge' or 'imprinted upon the mind',   
then we require a new category for abilities of this sort, otherwise, 
they are innate knowledge.    So, it is probable that infants know <em>something</em> innately.</p>

<p>Locke clearly explains the method in which the mind acquires its first pieces of knowledge: "The senses at first <em>let in</em> particular ideas, and <em>furnish</em> the yet empty cabinet, and the mind by degrees growing <em>familiar with</em> some of them, they are <em>lodged</em> in memory, and names <em>got to them</em>. Afterwards the mind    proceeding further <em>abstracts them</em>, and by degrees <em>learns</em> the use of general names. In this manner the mind <em>come to be furnished</em>
 with ideas and language" (I, ii, 15, my italics). There   are quite a 
few verbs being used in these propositions. As a result, the mind seems 
to be quite an active participant in its acquisition of knowledge. It 
has to <em>let things in</em>, <em>furnish</em> its memory, <em>grow familiar</em> with its newly acquired ideas, <em>get</em> names to all these ideas, and then <em>learn</em> general names for them. How can it do all these things without <em>knowledge of how to do all these things</em>?
 The letting in of ideas, I grant, may perhaps be passive (like the 
letting in of  sunshine through a window; the window does not need to 
know how to do this). But what of    the furnishing of the cabinet? This
 is only an analogy, but the mind is clearly doing something active 
which would require it to <em>know</em> how to  perform this action. Similarly with the rest of the verbs, the mind must <em>know</em> how to do them before it is able to do them! Therefore, by Locke's own admission, the mind  <em>knows</em> something in the first stages of its development.</p>

<p>Having no understanding of the linguistic domain does not necessarily
 constitute having no understanding of knowledge what ever.    Locke, 
thus, leaves room for possible innate knowledge in his arguments since 
he only takes language-oriented (or propositional)    knowledge into 
consideration. As well, from infants' abilities at birth which can be   
 observed and inferred (e.g., quieting when in mother's arms; awareness 
of 'hunger'; being upset when given confused, that is, contradictory, 
signals), there are examples of possible knowledge which   may be 
innately imprinted upon the mind. And, by Locke's own argument, the mind
 must know something in its initial stages   of development in order for
 it to furnish itself with <em>new</em> knowledge (specifically that of 
the linguistic kind).   Therefore, Locke does not rule out the 
possibility of innate knowledge and by further reasoning it may be seen 
that innate principles are indeed    quite probable (I do not say    
'certain' because we cannot peer directly into prenatal minds in order 
to learn what is actually going on inside).  Nevertheless, innate 
principles or ideas are <em>probable</em>.</p>
