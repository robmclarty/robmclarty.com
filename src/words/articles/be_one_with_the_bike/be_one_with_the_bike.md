Humans are distinguished amongst the natural world not by any advantagious
physical trait, but by augmenting our natural traits with new ones that we
invent ourselves. We'll loose in a running race versus a cheetah. A bear will
always dominate us in a fist fight. We can't match the endurance of a horse. We
could not hope to swim as fast as a dolphin. We can't breathe the CO2 air near
a vulcano like some plants. Nor can we endure the extreme cold of the antarctic
like the penguins (or the extreme heat of the sahara like the scorpions). We're
really not well adapted to any environment better than other native life if we
were left out in the world completely naked and with no knowledge.

But we have big fat brains and opposable thumbs, and with those, we've been able
to augment our limitations with tools that have enabled us to not only survive,
but dominate the natural world of Earth. In this sense, what defines a human
qua human, is not just her water-sack body, but also, necessarily, her tools.
Without our tools, we're not whole. We define them, and they define us.

With fire we can keep warm in the coldest climates and can eat un-fresh food
without getting sick. With sharp blade edges made of rock and metal we can hunt
game and slice it for cooking. With motors we can move across the landscape
many many times faster than any muscle-bound animal. And whenever a new
challenge confronts us, threatening our existence, we never cease our quest to
find new ways to dominate nature. It is our tools, or machines, combined with
our bodies that define what it is to be "human".

But there are different combinations of body + machine. Some tools are more body
than machine, like a hammer, or a brick. They demand a larger proportion of
resources to come from our bodies for them to reach their potential. Other
tools are more machine than body, like our planes, trains, and automobiles
which allow us to use little to no effort from out bodies to exert extreme
forces upon the world. And then there are others which find a good balance
between both body and machine, like the bicycle.

I find bicycles to be the most the interesting, existentially, of all our tools.
A bicycle is a massively efficient machine which translates energy from our
human bodies in motion and enables us to explore our world at beyond-natural
speeds. They instil our minds with freedom, but are fueled by our force of
will. Only continents, gravity, and the resistance of the wind limit our
possibilities on a bicycle. But a bicycle is not useful without a corresponding
human body; and a human body without a bicycle is only a slow moving, local,
creature. It is an almost perfect balance of body + machine. Riding a bike is
the most quintessentially human phenomenon one can experience.
