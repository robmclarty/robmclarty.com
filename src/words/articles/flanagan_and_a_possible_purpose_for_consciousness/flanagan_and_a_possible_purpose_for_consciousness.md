Owen Flanagan, in his article "Conscious Inessentialism and the
Epiphenomenalist Suspicion", talks about the possible role consciousness
plays in our species, developed through evolution. Exemplified by the
experiment of Libet (361-362), he believes that consciousness is like a
final approval of an action that the brain has already initiated but has
not yet executed.   Once approved, the action is done; if not approved,
consciousness allows for the possibility of holding back before any
damage is done...

I rather like this explanation as it makes sense to me, especially in
terms of evolution. Unlike the Epiphenomenalist   who believes that
consciousness is a sort of evolutionary accident - a feature which
hitched a ride on the evolutionary train but serves no actual function
(like the appendix) - I believe, as Flanagan seems tom, that
consciousness was specifically selected for as a means of  better
survival. "Consciousness is a matter of good evolutionary design" (360).

It could be imagined that consciousness has been selected for because
those individuals who hesitated and double checked their actions, *before*
executing an action, were the ones who survived and transmitted their
genes. For example, being hungry (maybe even starving) and seeing an
easily killed child animal cross my path (readily available food and an
end to my hunger), I would see and opportunity to kill and eat this
animal without any immediate problems, thus eliminating my lack of
energy. If I was not conscious (i.e., I did not hesitate and consider my
action to kill the animal before actually executing the action) then I
would probably be killed later when the mother of the child sees what I
have done to her offspring. Thus my line of genes would be at an end.
Quick, non-hesitant action might kill the animal and achieve much needed
food for my survival more efficiently, but in the long run it puts me
in greater danger. So the hesitation actually helps and is good
evolutionary design.

Now it could be argued that, say, a robot could be programmed to
analyze its surroundings and make probability judgements based on how
much energy it had left, how much time it had remaining before it
required more energy, what the risk of acquiring some particular energy
would be, weighing this risk next to the amount of time its current
supply of energy would sustain it for, etc.. The robot could probably
avoid the trap of ingesting energy that could possibly destroy it (as
with the animal mother; or in this case maybe an angry battery salesman)
without actually being *aware* or *conscious* of what was
happening (i.e., it is all a result of innate programming). But the
point is, as Flanagan makes it, that it is not that it is *possible*
for beings such as ourselves to do the things we do without
consciousness (implying that consciousness has no purpose) but that it
was necessary for us to have developed consciously (i.e., consciousness
was purposely selected for since those of our ancestors without
consciousness did not survive).

In the game of evolution, consciousness is a good card to hold. In
the example of the robot, we have created something which has no risk of
being   destroyed (because we are always around to look out for it).
Even if there *was* a risk (as in the example), it might be able
to avoid THAT particular risk, but could not adapt to different
situations. The creatures in evolution which could hesitate and consider
things in different situations survived; the robot, left on its own in
the world, would probably die (when the angry salesman wanted his
batteries back). Thus, although consciousness is not needed for
individual existence, it is essential for the survival of a species in
an ever changing and potentially hostile environment.
