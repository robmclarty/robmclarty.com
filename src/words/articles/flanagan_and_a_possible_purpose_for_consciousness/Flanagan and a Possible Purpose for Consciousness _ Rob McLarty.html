<p>Owen Flanagan, in his article "Conscious Inessentialism and the 
Epiphenomenalist Suspicion", talks about the possible role consciousness
 plays in our species, developed through evolution. Exemplified by the 
experiment of Libet (361-362), he believes that consciousness is like a 
final approval of an action that the brain has already initiated but has
 not yet executed.   Once approved, the action is done; if not approved,
 consciousness allows for the possibility of holding back before any 
damage is done...</p>

<p>I rather like this explanation as it makes sense to me, especially in
 terms of evolution. Unlike the Epiphenomenalist   who believes that 
consciousness is a sort of evolutionary accident - a feature which 
hitched a ride on the evolutionary train but serves no actual function 
(like the appendix) - I believe, as Flanagan seems tom, that 
consciousness was specifically selected for as a means of  better 
survival. "Consciousness is a matter of good evolutionary design" (360).</p>

<p>It could be imagined that consciousness has been selected for because
 those individuals who hesitated and double checked their actions, <em>before</em>
 executing an action, were the ones who survived and transmitted their 
genes. For example, being hungry (maybe even starving) and seeing an 
easily killed child animal cross my path (readily available food and an 
end to my hunger), I would see and opportunity to kill and eat this 
animal without any immediate problems, thus eliminating my lack of 
energy. If I was not conscious (i.e., I did not hesitate and consider my
 action to kill the animal before actually executing the action) then I 
would probably be killed later when the mother of the child sees what I 
have done to her offspring. Thus my line of genes would be at an end. 
Quick, non-hesitant action might kill the animal and achieve much needed
 food for my survival more efficiently, but in the long run it puts me 
in greater danger. So the hesitation actually helps and is good 
evolutionary design.</p>

<p>Now it could be argued that, say, a robot could be programmed to 
analyze its surroundings and make probability judgements based on how 
much energy it had left, how much time it had remaining before it 
required more energy, what the risk of acquiring some particular energy 
would be, weighing this risk next to the amount of time its current 
supply of energy would sustain it for, etc.. The robot could probably 
avoid the trap of ingesting energy that could possibly destroy it (as 
with the animal mother; or in this case maybe an angry battery salesman)
 without actually being <em>aware</em> or <em>conscious</em> of what was
 happening   (i.e., it is all a result of innate programming). But the 
point is, as Flanagan makes it, that it is not that it is <em>possible</em>
 for beings such as ourselves to do the things we do without 
consciousness (implying that consciousness has no purpose) but that it 
was necessary for us to have developed consciously (i.e., consciousness 
was purposely selected for since those of our ancestors without 
consciousness did not survive).</p>

<p>In the game of evolution, consciousness is a good card to hold. In 
the example of the robot, we have created something which has no risk of
 being   destroyed (because we are always around to look out for it). 
Even if there <em>was</em> a risk (as in the example), it might be able 
to avoid THAT particular risk, but could not adapt to different 
situations. The creatures in evolution which could hesitate and consider
 things in different situations survived; the robot, left on its own in 
  the world, would probably die (when the angry salesman wanted his 
batteries back). Thus, although consciousness is not needed for 
individual existence, it is essential for the survival of a species in 
an ever changing and potentially hostile environment.</p>
