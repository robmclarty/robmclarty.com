<h2>Birth</h2>

<p>I remember the one moonlit night.  The night that I first became 
aware.  The night that I, as a thinking, feeling, understanding, 
conscious being was born.  It was a full, white, and ominous moon 
looking back down at me.  It guided me into the light of existence and I
 began to see the world around me as something that could be 
comprehended.  It was no longer the buzzing, whirring confusion of 
infanthood.  It was now beginning to take shape in my mind.  My mind, in
 turn, was beginning to take shape of itself and became sentient.</p>

<p>Recalling thoughts, long past, through the white haze of memory, my 
contemporary consciousness elicits forgotten experiences.  As awareness 
made its progress into understanding, the world became organized and the
 pieces of that great puzzle were able to be defined (even if they were,
 not yet, able to be fitted together.)</p>

<p>The trees in the darkness seemed to obscure parts of the moon as the 
entourage of my mother and sister passed under autumn stripped branches.
  But its light continued to seep through to meet my eyes in an intimate
 transfixiation.  Unlike any other beauty, this moon was the first.  
Breaking through non-understanding, it became in my mind the first 
conceptual package that would be the basis for all future 
contemplations.  At this moment, as it passed from hazy, ill-defined, 
lit, confusion into shaped, clear, discernment, it was, simply, the most
 beautiful experience I have ever had.</p>

<p>At this one instant, all things were possible.  At the beginning of 
experience, the infinity of all possible experiences still exists.  I 
was only beginning to leave The Garden to venture out into the world of 
rational thought, but at the moment of the transition it seemed that 
nothing could compare to the wonder of experience and knowledge.  I 
wanted more, and was excited by life's adventure.
The moon reflected the sun's light, not unlike a mirror, making it 
possible to see most of the same details at night that one would see 
during daytime hours.  Almost surreal in this night's appearance, my 
thinking began to take hold and I realized my own existence.  The light 
of understanding hit my retina and illuminated my soul.</p>

<h2>Childhood</h2>

<p>Novel perceptions abound and are continuously impacting my mind.  
Playing in my sandbox in the back yard of my house, many adventures of 
imagination ensue from my construction of miniature landscapes.  As yet,
 I do not fully grasp the difference between what is "real" and what is 
not.  For my own amusement, the experiences that I dream on my own are 
just as fulfilling and exciting as those that come from without.</p>

<p>The sand surrounds me with its endless forms.  It can be molded to 
any shape that I desire.  Here a castle, there a river, a hill, a 
meadow, a world of plastic reality.  No stone lies here in my world of 
play.  The sand takes whatever shape my hands afford.  There are no 
limits to its potential.</p>

<p>Everything is new, and it is good.  Oblivious to the harshness of 
things beyond my realm (my sandbox,) my innocent playtime provides me 
with a wide open door to what can be.  Alone in my bliss, my mind is 
curious about the workings of reality (my reality.)  No matter what 
investigations I pursue, interest is always satisfied and a feeling of 
security is prevalent.</p>

<p>No worries.  No responsibilities.  No problems.  The world (my world)
 makes sense.  The many possibilities of future endeavor are all of them
 probable and I begin to pick and choose various paths and directions.  
The genesis of projects take hold and the sand begins to take shape.  
Hope abounds.  Anything is possible.
Any thing can still, yet, come to be.</p>

<h2>Phenomena</h2>

<p>I wander and meander through my grandfather’s garden, observing all 
the plants and insects as they blow in the summer’s breeze.  So many 
things to see here in this small microcosm of reality.  I can smell the 
daisies as they bloom in the rising sun’s warmth.  I can feel the 
tingling of blades of grass as they tickle my bare feet and move in 
recoil of my weight upon them.  I can hear the buzzing of the bees, 
their sacs full of the pollen that the flowers produce for them in their
 intimate dance:  their cosmic relationship made manifold.  The varying 
array of flora blast my eyes with every possible colour of the spectrum 
of light to which human eyes are sensitive.  My tongue tastes of the 
sweet air that lingers about the fruit and waits for its turn to begin 
the creation of life one more time; to fall to ashes and rise again.</p>

<p>The abundance of phenomena beyond my thoughts is awesome.  The 
plethora of colours and shapes; almost incomprehensible.  The world is a
 magnificent garden of wonder.  Some times it seems simply too much to 
take in at one time.  An infinity of splendors hitting my senses 
overloads my mind with reality.  How could all these things be?  How 
could I be here, right now, experiencing them?  Is there any end to this
 kaleidoscope of being?</p>

<p>When I close my eyes, the visual world vanishes, and yet reappears 
when I again open them.  Did the world of my eyes cease to be, only to 
be recreated as I looked at it a second time?  For a moment, reality 
itself was dark.  The world that I perceived was changed by the way in 
which my own body received the sensational information that was buzzing 
about me.  My world is at the mercy of my eyes.  My reality is what I 
perceive.</p>

<p>Even more odd, is the way in which this garden presents itself to me 
when I am in different moods.  When I am angry at the bee for stinging 
me, I see less of garden as a whole, and concentrate solely on the 
stinger lodged in my skin.  When I have no fears or apprehensions, my 
consciousness wonders and I seem to be able to take in the whole garden 
at once, seeing all the little details, the snails, the soil, the air, 
the sun, the geraniums, and the compost, all simultaneously.  When I am 
sad, I do not see anything at all but my own inner world of despair and 
solitude.  When I am afraid, I open my eyes to all possible avenues of 
escaping it.  When I am feeling differently, the world around me seems 
different.  Even my self seems different depending upon what I am 
thinking or how I am feeling.  My mind wonders at the endless 
possibilities of phenomenal being and I am overwhelmed by its grandeur.</p>

<p>Playing with existence and time itself, I discover how my whole 
experience is dependant upon my own thoughts and feelings.  I learn that
 what I am thinking affects what I am experiencing.  I begin to see the 
relationship between my mind and my world.  Thinking things are real 
experiences too.</p>

<h2>Understanding</h2>

<p>What do I know?  What is knowledge?  Is enough knowledge 
comprehension?  I may be aware of a thing, but yet still not understand 
it.  As I look down at my grandfather’s remains, I realize that I do not
 understand what this bulk of matter means.  I know it (I knew him) but I
 was never afforded the opportunity to understand what “him” was.</p>

<p>Understanding is beautiful and desirable.  It takes effort to understand and through this effort, we live and know why we live.</p>

<p>My grandfather’s body is here, but he is no longer here.  That which 
made this grouping of matter self aware and able to see the world is no 
longer functioning.<br>
I may never be able to truly know what “he” was:  what that meant.  I 
may never be able to know anything really (all that I have experienced 
is unique to me simply as the set of sensational input that has made up 
this ride of consciousness that I am on.)  But even so, I may be able to
 understand.  That is, I may be able to see the multiple possibilities 
of the universe, while not knowing which one is actually the case.  But 
being aware of the possibilities is like “knowing” each case altogether.
  Understanding all possible worlds allows for the embracing of 
existence for what it is.  By knowing what possible turns the ride might
 take, I understand the ride for what it is (for what possible things it
 can do and possible places it can take me) and am prepared for 
eventualities and can then enjoy it.  By understanding the limits and 
boundaries of what the ride can do, I can play around with it more, and 
enjoy myself to a greater degree.  I can push those limits and make a 
few of my own.  I can expand the ride just a little (stretch it this way
 and that) enabling those riding behind me to find this extra bit of 
thrill and enjoy their experience that much more.  Understanding is the 
seed of all interest.</p>

<h2>The Unknown</h2>

<p>What I don't already know is frightening to me.  All possible 
scenarios could occur and of those possibilities, a great many of them 
are undesirable.  It is a risk to accept that some unwanted 
possibilities could occur, but the possibility of goodness also exists. 
 If the risk is not taken, you are safe and do not need to worry about 
the bad, but you will also never achieve the good.</p>

<p>How will I know how far the limits of existence reach unless I try to
 find them?  How can any of us be happy simply accepting what we already
 have; accepting existence as is.  If we do not expand our horizons and 
push the limits farther, we will loose interest and the reaction of life
 and thought will die.</p>

<p>But it is hard to travel near the Wall (let alone climbing over it.) 
 How can we know how to get over it?  No one has done it before, and 
there are no guides.  If I make it over what will I find there?  Will I 
be able to find my way back?  If I find something interesting will I be 
able to show it to the others?  What if I become lost and am unable to 
return back to the ordered world of understanding?  What if I go mad?  
What if I die?</p>

<p>I still think it is worth the risk to be able to find new beauty and 
new happiness.  Beauty can only be found in the new understanding of the
 unknown.  Only in that which we do not already know (the chaos) can we 
find wonderment.  I do not try to know what I already know because I 
know it.  And that which I do not already know, I will eventually know, 
because I know where to look:  it can be found in the deepest recesses 
of the soul.  Pushed far enough, and reaching up high enough, we may be 
able to stretch just enough to touch something almost beyond our grasp. 
 The unknown, the chaos, the disorganization, the darkness; it lives 
inside each of us, inside each of our minds.  It may seem frightening 
and dangerous, but only because we are not able to decipher its 
language.  With enough practice and experience with it, though, we may 
be able to understand a little bit more of its puzzle.</p>

<p>And so, into the deep my pathway leads me.</p>

<h2>Confusion</h2>

<p>Why am I here?  How did I get to where I am?  What are all these 
things that are happening to me?  I don't understand.  They are so 
jumbled in my head.  In a magnificent deluge of crossing thoughts I, 
that thing, that essence, that sum of all thoughts, the thing that is 
thinking, the grand category of all existence:  I am lost.</p>

<p>What will be happening to me henceforth?  Will it be good?  Will I be
 able to manage that which has not yet come to pass?  Has all that is 
worth having happened already done so?  I am faultering.  I am doubting.
  I am unsure of myself.  I am out at sea without a compass and the 
stars are clouded over.  I am lost.
I am sitting down in my apartment at art school.  I am surveying the 
collection of books that I have read, and some that I have not.  I am 
considering these many words and analyzing their worth.  These are the 
ideas of all those before me.  Here lies the hints humanity has to offer
 towards solving the puzzle.  And yet none of them are able to describe 
this instance, this moment, this experience.  None of them can tell me 
what it is to be.  None of them are able to unravel the tangled knot of 
paths that lie before me and aid me in my descisions to choose the one 
that will become my life.  I am lost.</p>

<p>I am pondering the vastness of reality, my place there, and how it 
has all come to be.  That at once there was nothing, and now everything,
 but that at some moment, as yet unrealized, the stuff of creation will 
return from whence it came.  Oblivion approaches.  I am uncertain as to 
my readiness.  I still have many corridors to explore.  Watching my 
every move, ready to pounce, Death is my secret admirer.  I realize the 
abyss, and understand the bubble.  I am lost.</p>

<p>What are the stars?  Where are they going?  They have always been 
there.  Do they too wonder how they ended up in that specific, that 
exact point, in the night sky?  Are they concerned, as I am, that they 
will at any moment be blown out of existence, out of the great game (the
 great experience) back into the ineffable?  I am here, now, existing, 
thinking, worrying, dreaming.  I have in my grasp, this essence of 
being.  What is that worth?  What should I do with it?  I am lost.
I am lost.  I am lost.  Yes, yes, yes.  I know that I am lost.  The 
experience is interesting.  At moments it is beautiful.  At others, it 
is frightening.  I am existing, experiencing, understanding, and 
remembering.  I am realizing what it is that is happening.  I am 
understanding my situation.  This is what is happening, and simply this.
  This is all that life is:  this very moment.  This experience is all 
that is.  This is life.  This is direction.  This is destination: 
departure and arrival.  This is the nexus of all phenomena.  This is my 
dream.  This is me.  This is.</p>

<p>This is because I am.  All that I am can be found in this.  Thisness.  This.  This is it.  I am no longer as lost as I once was.</p>

<h2>Happiness</h2>

<p>I still do not really know what to make of everything, sitting here, 
being here.  I am not sure I have any answers, or that there even exist 
any answers to be had.  But I know that to make an effort, to be 
experiencing something (anything,) that is at least what living is.  To 
try and accomplish something (whatever it is, it does not matter); to 
care, to be passionate, to make an effort; this is embracing life and 
knowing it (understanding it and loving it and realizing its beauty:  
the beauty of creation and (temporal) existence.)  There is only now, 
and nothing can take this moment’s beauty away.  No bit of reasoning, or
 logical proof can take away the feeling (the experiencing) of a 
moment’s beauty.  There, in the moment, life, freedom, love, and 
understanding all are manifest.  They exist, they are real, and they are
 beautiful and they are good.</p>

<p>At least I know what it is to live, and, so, I can continue on 
living.  I have a better idea of what my place is in the world, and that
 is comforting.  To understand (a little bit better) what is going on in
 this white haze of existence is relieving.  Having a piece of the 
puzzle fall into place and be aware of its fitting (its organization and
 its sensedness relative to the whole) is a good feeling to say the 
least.  I am happy to know these things, to understand these things, to 
be aware of these things.  I want to continue living and exploring.  I 
want to find my way through the white haze to the other side of 
existence and know what it was to have traveled through that confusion. 
 I still want to be.</p>

<h2>Anger</h2>

<p>Sitting at home, on my couch, I am playing a videogame and trying my 
best to beat all the levels, but I keep making mistakes and failing.  
Again and again, I cannot seem to progress through this game.  I am no 
longer having any fun (any pleasure) and am finding myself more and more
 frustrated.  Still I cannot improve.  The more I become frustrated, the
 less attention I pay to the game, and the worse I become at playing it.
  And so the vicious circle goes to the point that I become openly angry
 at the little piece of metal and plastic that is causing me so many 
troubles.</p>

<p>My parents yell down to me from up the stairs to stop yelling at the 
devilish machine.  I catch myself and realize that indeed I was yelling 
out loud at the technology which could never hope to comprehend what I 
am saying or the agony that I am in.  Why do I think that losing my 
temper will help?  Or perhaps I could not help it, as I became angry it 
was beyond my control (I did not realize I was getting angry until I 
already was.)  It is very foolish and embarrassing, and thinking about 
how I have been behaving, I become even more angry with myself.
I need to stop.  I need to breath.  I need to quit concerning myself 
with that which angers me.  I am putting the game away.  I am walking 
upstairs to get something to eat.  I forget myself and chew on some 
crackers.  I am feeling better.  I am disappointed with myself for 
letting my emotions take over myself.</p>

<p>Not many things exist that can enrage me, but they do exist.  Things 
that I expect to be a certain way, but result not, simply irritate me.  
The workings of the computer in front of me encapsulates this point 
exactly.  Anticipating a certain outcome, and knowing that the computer 
follows logical rules, the outcome should necessarily occur.  But some 
times, this is not the case.  With no logical explanation for this 
anomaly, and in desperate need of the end result, my muscles become 
tense, my blood pressure rises, and my teeth are clenched.  If only the 
computer would tell me why.  Why?  Why won't it work properly?  Please 
work!  Please!  But it doesn't hear my pleas, and continues to muck-up 
my business.  This is the definition of anger for me.</p>

<h2>Language</h2>

<p>As we become able to share our feelings, we are no longer alone in 
the world.
Some may be able to transfer their thoughts to another through speaking;
 through words.  Others may find it necessary to represent their idea 
visually, with paint or sculpture or design.  Perhaps others find ideas 
of interest in the stimulation of taste buds?  Whatever the medium of 
communication, languages enable us to share our experiences with those 
of others.  We are able to learn what could not be experienced in our 
lifetimes by simply swapping one life with another, doubling the number 
of things we are able to know.</p>

<p>But a language is only useful as far as there exists a method of 
interpreting it successfully.  If the language cannot be understood, 
then the ideas are lost.  If we store our ideas in a computer databank, 
we must retain the ability to decipher the bumps (the ones and the 
zeros) or else the language is useless and the thoughts that were stored
 away, outside the mind, die and loose all their energy.  If an idea 
does not reside in a mind (e.g., only in the pages of a book) then it is
 not an idea.  Until some mind opens the book and transfers the written 
language into mental experience, the idea is in limbo (that is, it is 
still en route from the writer’s mind to that of the reader, and is 
still as yet to become a full fledged idea.)  It is still possible to 
become an idea if someone finally understands it.  But until it is 
understood, it cannot be said to be part of the mental world.  If a tree
 falls down in the middle of the forest and no one is around to hear it,
 the tree does not make a sound.</p>

<p>And so, language is the stepping stone from one side of the river to 
the next.  It is not the idea itself, but the bridge which allows for 
the passage of ideas across the void from one mind to another.  If no 
one travels across the bridge (if no one actually uses it,) then the 
bridge is useless.  When attempting to transfer an experience to another
 mind, be sure to provide a road map that leads up to the bridge before 
hand, so that the near-sided, who cannot see the bridge in the distance,
 may be enabled to reach it as well, allowing the bridge to become more 
greatly used and allow more lost souls to enjoy the other side of the 
river that you were able to cross.</p>

<h2>Beauty</h2>

<p>Trying to push the boundaries of thought, beauty is manifest in the 
short period of realization that is brought on from the transference of 
information from the unknown chaos (resultant of entropy) to the heated 
organization of thought-induced complexity. Being a warm-blooded 
creature of the hot-loving chain-reaction of the ordered universe, 
naturally I find pleasure in the intensification of stagnated and frozen
 matter; reintroduced into the decaying embrace of ever changing life.</p>

<h2>Love</h2>

<p>Passions wrap themselves around my soul as I am wrapped around those 
of others’.  The other minds that I have touched are precious to me.  In
 their eyes I play with them and share with them my experiences and in 
turn they share their own.  We each help one another gain a different 
glimpse of the world around us.  Through each other’s eyes, we are able 
to see a richer world, full of complexities and beauties.  I care deeply
 for those shared experiences and ideas.  I care for the differing 
viewpoints and alternate understandings.  I wish to know more of them 
and would hate to see them fade away.</p>

<p>Two minds come together in a bond of mutual understanding:  
understanding that each are a unique, highly complex, arrangement of 
stardust formed and molded in such a way that a new dimension of 
existence is manifest in its design.  Inside the dreams and thoughts of 
the chemical reaction lie new qualities and new possibilities.  We each 
contain our own doorways to unique constructions of thoughts and matter.
  We are each a special piece of the universe able to understand itself.
  It is a sad day when one of us passes away; a certain aspect of the 
ever-growing ideal world dying.  But with the renewal of the mental food
 chain, new minds, and new thoughts, the psychological reaction is able 
to continue its existence.</p>

<h2>Depression</h2>

<p>Looking about me, I find it hard to follow the path.  I do not know 
what lies at the end of the path.  I am frightened.  I am loosing 
confidence that following this pathway is the right thing to do.  I 
realize that I do not know what the right thing to do is.  I realize 
that I do not even know what “the right thing to do” means!  Darkness 
creeps across the landscape.  I feel alone.  I don’t want to move 
anymore.  I don’t care about anything around me.  I want to block out 
the rest of the world and just stay where I am, inside my own world of 
dreams and ideas.  I just want to go to sleep and never wake up.</p>

<h2>Dream</h2>

<p>I close my eyes, and a great expanse of gridded lattice engulfs my 
inner visual world.  My waking dream takes the form of a vanishing point
 at which all lines converge and become one.  Reds and blues and 
yellowish white light flow down these lines to a central meeting and 
then fizzle away to make room for newer flows of this energy.</p>

<p>Fireflies buzz in and out of my field of view.  I am unable to focus 
on any one of them, but together they create a sort of evenly 
distributed pattern of dancing light which is soothing.  Watching these 
frolicking lights bounce about the open expanse of my dream, I am lost 
in its beauty and, for the moment, forget the world without.</p>

<p>As I concentrate harder, I am able to make the dim imaginations 
become brighter to the point that their intensity is that of those 
colours that are perceived outside in the world of my body.  Brighter 
and brighter my inner world becomes until it seems to me just as real as
 anything else that I have experienced.
The fireflies change and become the refracting light poking through the 
maze of reflections in crystal symmetry.  Through the endless pathways 
of primsmatic entrapment, the light that escapes to meet my eyes is that
 of every conceivable colour in the rainbow.  I can see, in one 
instance, the palette of God and know with what possible beauty the 
world was created.  This primordial data from which all visual 
experience is constructed encapsulates all possible aesthetic value that
 could ever be had.</p>

<p>It is difficult to turn away; to open my lids and return to the more 
ordered and specific world of my body.  I am lost in my own imagination.
  Inside my own mind, anything is still knowingly possible.  I can see 
all that I want to see, and not what I am forced to observe.  Inside my 
mind, I am God.  How can I go back to that other realm of hardship and 
struggle?  The brightness and excitement inside are so much more 
fulfilling.</p>

<p>But.</p>

<p>Is this world of mine really meaningful?  If this is what I call my 
life, is that enough?  Seeing what can be is not the same as seeing what
 is.  This abstract set of possible experiences is no one experience on 
its own.  To really live (that is, to experience) is to be in a specific
 place, at a specific time, and experience a specific array of senses.  
This fabricated world of my mind is the experience of possibility (a 
sort of specific experience which is useful to indulge from time to 
time) but it does not encompass experience.  With my life (my one 
opportunity to be and to embrace) I want to see what is really out there
 (for my mind can really only conjure up a small subset of those 
possibilities that are outside.)  The world (of the body) may be less 
perfect or less bright, but it is also less derived and less copied and 
less known.  Existence in that world is a privilege simply because it 
contains the possibility of the unknown.  How could I know how good that
 world could be if I do not even know it all?  I think that it is worth 
investigating and learning about.  And I won’t have a second chance to 
do so.
My self, my identity, that which I am is the set of experiences and 
thoughts that are contained in this directory of existence.  I am the 
sum total of that which I have done, really.  Even those occasions on 
which I have delved into the inner world of imagination, I was really 
experiencing an inner experience in the outer world.  So, what matters 
lies out there, and I am what happens in here.  What a psychotic episode
 this whole experience really is!</p>

<h2>Memory</h2>

<p>How have all these memories accumulated in my consciousness?  I 
remember some things, and others I simply remember that they once were; 
yet I cannot remember their actual details.  How could all these great 
many things have happened to me?  It is a strange and wonderful 
experience, this thing we call existence.  Where once there was nothing,
 and where there will eventually be not, now there is all this stuff!  
How did all this suddenly take shape in this crazy world?
I recall walking with my mother to the grocery store at night and seeing
 the moon through the branches of the trees; it's beauty impressing 
itself upon my mind.  I remember the sandbox, the adventures of 
creation.  Lego, snow forts, woodland hikes, swimming, French, zoos, 
playgrounds, school, friends, food, discoveries, loss, happiness, love, 
depression, anger, beauty, and understanding.  All inside my head, 
somewhere, retrieved and experienced within consciousness.
The greatest gift of life must be the record of its experiences in 
memory.  To be able to remember that first experience and recall the 
newness, the firstness of it.  You can only fall in love for the first 
time once.  But you can remember that first time as many times as you 
desire.  What a wonderful ability!</p>

<p>Thinking back, I remember the innocence of youth.  I remember its 
carelessness and non-existent responsibility.  I live now in a world of 
understanding and learning.  I have the knowledge to see the 
possibilities and understanding what hope really is.  My world is 
somewhat more limited and less fresh as a result.  But I also know that I
 once lived in the Garden, and that it was good.  I may be banished, 
now, forever, but the experiences I took with me have been worth the 
sacrifice.  And with greater understanding, comes greater awareness of 
other possible experiences which could not have been possible otherwise.
  The intellect may divorce innocence from the soul, but it brings with 
it its own array of experiences and goodness.  And with the faculty of 
memory, I will never need to look for that innocence again, because it 
still exists in the depths of my mind.
My memories define who I am.  Those things that I remember, those images
 that I conjure in my mind's eye, those events and experiences that I 
know I once had, those are what I am.  If they could be manifest as a 
physical thing, I could point to them and say "there I am", "that's me."
  Without them, I am nothing more than an instinctual animal:  vessel 
within which my genes may propagate.
It has been a long ride, and I still have far to go, but thus far I have
 had some fun on it.  The bumps and swerves that I have rolled through 
were scary at times, but I have enjoyed them overall.  The thrill of the
 ride is exillerating and the not knowing what will be happening next 
has been daunting at times.  But I've lived through it.  The ride hasn't
 killed me yet.  I may still fall off the tracks, but for the bit of 
rails that I can see ahead of me, I believe that the ride will continue.</p>

<p>Looking behind me, I can see the twisted track that I followed up 
until now, and I can look ahead at what is to come with a toughened 
resolve.  I can take it.  I will prevail.  I am who I am, and this is my
 ride.  I am damned well going to enjoy it no matter what happens, and 
no other ride can interfere with my satisfaction.</p>

<p>My life, my ride, will be a memorable one regardless.</p>

<h2>Madness</h2>

<p>How did all this happen?  How did this construct of experiences 
manifest itself around this thing that I call myself?  What is going 
on!?
I see this twisting, swerving, vacillating influx of sensory entrés. I 
taste of this and I embrace of that.  It is a buffet of deserts, and it 
is consistently within my reach.</p>

<p>I am looking at my reflection in the bathroom mirror.  This 
representational image of refracted light is a strange organization of 
photonic energy.  It responds to what I respond.  It moves as I move.  
And yet it is not me, and it is me at the same time.  Seeing into my own
 eyes, I look into the perceiver gazing into my own gaze.  I am 
transfixed with the thought of my identity.  What does it mean to see 
one’s soul?</p>

<p>With the doubting of everything outside, with the questioning of all 
that is real, I find myself just as real as anything else in reality.  I
 don’t care if my friends are real (or unreal) because they are still 
just as human as I am.  Life is not about what it means to be real (that
 is, what it means to exist) but what it means to be human (what it 
means to live; what it means to feel; what it means to embrace the great
 experiences of time; what it means to wonder; what it means to love; 
what it means to work and what that work will be.)</p>

<p>Life is nothing but a white haze.  It is a great confusion and then I
 die.  At first there is black nothingness, then this white haze 
(possible somethingness) and then I will return to the black depths of 
oblivion.  That’s it.
Living is the act of experiencing the reality around me.  And by 
experiencing, by living, I am able to realize myself; to realize what it
 is to be a human being; to be a thinking thing in the vastness of the 
universe, here, now, experiencing it, and being able to realize its 
grandeur; to realize that there is this white haze of stuff that is 
happening.  Without this happening, there is not life, there is only 
void, black, nothingness.</p>

<p>Why do I create art?  Why do I live?  What's the point in simply 
existing?  I exist to live.  I live to create art.  I create art to 
explore my humanity; to see how deep it goes; to see what it means; to 
know myself. Before I die I should at least know myself.  But it is 
difficult, and there are no instructions.  There are guides.  There are 
those who have come before me who struggled with the same problems and 
wrote down, at least, what they were able to find out so that I can now 
learn and begin my journey of exploration with a boat instead of 
venturing out into the sea (the unknown) with nothing but a raft (that 
is, they have provided me with some tools and maps (however misdirected 
they may turn out to be) that I can make use of in my adventure into the
 deep.)</p>

<p>Maybe life is pointless.  But I should at least realize its 
pointlessness and move on.  That is, realizing the situation for what it
 is allows me the freedom to live life for what it is.  That is, I can 
live life, because nothing is left to hold me back: no worries, no 
confusions, no second guesses, and no insecurities.  Clearly 
understanding life is valuable, but I can't know it.  I'll never know.  I
 don't know what's going on, and never will (understanding what is 
possible is quite different from knowing what is.)  But who cares?</p>

<h2>Oblivion</h2>

<p>Eventually this ride of mine will come to an end, and I will return 
from whence I came.  As my existence fades, I will approach nothingness 
once again.  At one time there was nothing, and once again nothing will 
return.  We only live once.  We have but one verse in the epic of human 
life, and that verse will, at one point, be over and the epic will 
continue on after it.  What will our verse be?  What will we contribute 
to the great work of civilization?  Will my existence have even made a 
difference to the grand scheme of things, or will I fade away to 
nothingness, having lived for nothing, never having really existed at 
all?</p>

<p>I am now alive, so I should live.  I won't be able to do it again.  I
 should experience to my heart's content.  With such limited time I 
should try to get my money's worth.  This crazy reality, this world, 
this universe, this plain of existence, is here and simply is.  I am a 
very small part of that grandness, but I have the chance to affect it.  
From within my small little world of understanding and experience, from 
within my own thoughts, I can go out and affect the larger world.  I can
 change it, make it different than it was based on my own feelings and 
ideas.  I can let others, for generations to come, know what it is that I
 thought about this great ride.  I can share my experiences and share my
 understanding, letting others in on my bit of my solution (the small 
piece of the puzzle that I was able to fit into the great jigsaw) so 
that they can be able to build upon that success and have a head-start 
themselves at finding the overall solution.  I cannot let these ideas be
 lost in oblivion.</p>

<p>I appreciated the records and stored data that has been accumulated 
throughout the history of civilization.  The ideas of my ancestors has 
aided me in developing my own ideas.  I have been able to build upon 
their part of the puzzle, and contribute something new to the rest of my
 brethren.  I may not be able to solve the metaphysical problems, I may 
not be able to tell you where neutrinos come from or how the universe 
began, but if anything I can show you beauty, I can show you a few novel
 experiences, and I can explain why these novel experiences are worth 
having.  Even if this is all that I am able to do for the rest of my 
species, I believe that it is worth it.  Even one, new, novel, never 
been had before, experience is worth having, and that if nothing else, 
can be my gift to our race.</p>

<p>Before I pass out of existence and return to nirvana, I hope that I 
can leave behind some evidence of experiences worth having.  That is, I 
can show others the switch-tracks to take on the ride that will be more 
enjoyable than others; more worthwhile.  All there is, is the ride, but 
some parts of the ride are more worth it than others.  I hope that it is
 these parts that I can highlight and let people become aware of 
themselves so that they can look forward to and have some bit of 
experience that is good on their own rides.  Because in the end, we all 
return to nothing.  In the end, all we have is what we got out of the 
ride.  In the end, all we have is ourselves.  In the end, there is only 
the end.</p>
