      Hi, I'm Rob. I like playing with computers, riding my bike, drawing
      pictures, reading philosophy, and dreaming about one day finishing a project!

        I live downtown by myself and work for a startup, sitting in various
        adjustable chairs, pressing various plastic buttons, and reading a lot of
        the same thing over and over again. I live in the Cloud&trade;.

        I wonder a lot about the absurdity of conscious existence and grapple with
        the phenomena of Being. I'm looking to find some sense of balance.

        One thing this pandemic is teaching me is that there is
        only <em>now</em>, and there's no time to waste holding back one's truth.
