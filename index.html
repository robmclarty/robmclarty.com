      Hi, I'm Rob. I like playing with computers, riding my bike, drawing
      pictures, reading philosophy, and dreaming about one day finishing a project!

        I live downtown by myself and work for a startup, sitting in various
        ajustable chairs, pressing various plastic buttons, and reading a lot of of
        the same thing over and over again. I want to help people protect themselves
        from the network.

        I wonder a lot about the absurdity of conscious existence and grapple with
        the phenomena of Being whilst playing the role society has set for
        me&mdash;whilst trying not to think about any of it too hard&mdash;in an
        effort to find some sense of balance.

        I don't make friends very easily. I feel like most people I know only
        superficially. But one thing this pandemic is teaching me is that there is
        only <em>now</em>, and there's no time to waste holding back one's truth.
